# rogueplanet
 A ncurses-based game of planetary exploration
 You have landed on a planet and you need to build a colony there.

 I created this software to start my Github repository, but I will finish it.

 Type "make" to compile.

#About
 * Randomly generated planets and landing positions

#Required software
 * GCC
 * GNU Make
 * ncurses headers 
 * tar (to compress files). Make sure tar is in your PATH.

#Required hardware
 * RAM: 256 MB. RoguePlanet maps consume _a lot_ more memory than they need. I will fix this 
 * Processor: um... I think any processor where you can run Linux is good enough. (I don't have old computers to run)

### Note
Please run it on a 80x25 screen or a real terminal. Scrolling is _very_ slow on emulated terminals above 80x25.
